		<li>The Planck Constant:</li><br> "WRITTEN BY: The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"<p>

"Planck’s constant, (symbol h), fundamental physical 
constant characteristic of the mathematical<br> formulations of 
quantum mechanics, which describes the behaviour of particles and
 waves on the <br> atomic scale, including the particle aspect of light. 
 The German physicist Max Planck introduced <br>the constant in 1900 in his
 accurate formulation of the distribution of the radiation emitted by a<br>  blackbody,
 or perfect absorber of radiant energy (see Planck’s radiation law). The significance 
 of<br> Planck’s constant in this context is that radiation, such as light, is emitted, 
 transmitted, and absorbed<br>in discrete energy packets, or quanta, determined by the
 frequency of the radiation and the value <br>of Planck’s constant."
 
 <p> "The energy E of each 
 quantum, or each photon, equals Planck’s constant h times the radiation <br>frequency 
 symbolized by the Greek letter nu, ν, or simply E = hν. A modified form of Planck’s<br>
 constant called h-bar (ℏ), or the reduced Planck’s constant, in which ℏ equals h divided 
 by 2π, is <br>the quantization of angular momentum. For example, the angular momentum of an 
 electron bound <br>to an atomic nucleus is quantized and can only be a multiple of h-bar."
 
  <p> "The dimension of Planck’s constant is the product of energy multiplied by time, a quantity 
 called action.<br> Planck’s constant is often defined, therefore, as the elementary quantum of
 action. Its value in metre-<br> kilogram-second units is 6.62607004 × 10−34 joule∙second, with a
 standard uncertainty of 0.000000081 <br>× 10−34 joule∙second."

		<li>Quantum Computing:</li><br>"Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and
		exploiting the amazing laws of quantum mechanics<br> to process information. A traditional
		computer uses long strings of “bits,” which encode either a zero or<br> a one. A quantum computer,
		on the other hand, uses quantum bits, or qubits. What's the difference? Well<br> a qubit is a quantum
		system that encodes the zero and the one into two distinguishable quantum states. But,<br> because qubits 
		behave quantumly, we can capitalize on the phenomena of "superposition" and "entanglement."

	<li>Quantum Intelligence:</li><br> "The Evolution Of Intelligence"
		<br> 
		<br> 
"Are we what we are born as? Is intelligence something that is measurable by tests and
 dictated by<br>  genetics? OR.…..Are we what we choose to be in any moment? Is intelligence
 the degree to which<br>  we can
 expand and connect to a vaster intelligence and consciousness in any moment?
I say it’s the <br> latter! Our culture has a serious misunderstanding of intelligence and 
the workings of the mind. We’ve <br> been focusing on a physical, mind-only approach for way 
too long now. In truth, our intelligence extends <br> the depth and breadth of the universes 
and anyone, of any age, of any measurable IQ, can access this intelligence."

<p>
"Do you truly understand the implications of this? Any child can know anything they want, 
from any time, on<br>  any subject. Any person can ascertain the true meaning of situations as
 they arise, seeing the depth and breadth <br> of possibilities and potential in every moment.
 This is actually the truth of our human capacity for intelligence<br> …it stretches way beyond 
 the limits that we’ve lived under for so long now. It’s time to break the myth of IQ,<br> to extend
 the mind into the ‘great unknown’ and make it the ‘very well known’ for us all.
All the new abilities<br>(wisdom, knowing, innate sensing, telepathy and more) available to us are 
simply the inherent knowledge that’s <br> in the air (the energy) around us."

<p> "In the past, we were locked 
away in an individualistic and mind oriented culture, so how could we know there <br>was so much available 
to us? Today, in our open energy system, it’s now all there for the asking
I believe these <br>abilities are a part of our natural birthright. All human beings can read the 
sensory input around them. Many people<br> already have access to these abilities. In fact, some have
 had them all their lives. I was one of those people who never<br> had an inkling of these abilities 
 until some years ago when I began to open up. I say this to prove that it is possible<br> for anyone 
 and everyone to access these abilities, easily and graciously. Let’s take a look at each of these 
 abilities and <br>their corresponding level of intelligence to discover how they can be used to enhance
 life, work and creation."

		<li>"The Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) is home of one of the few 
		QKD prototypes in the world.<br> “Alice,” a device located at IQC headquarters,
		receives half of the entangled (highly correlated) one of<br> the photons generated 
		by a laser on the roof of a building at the University of Waterloo. “Bob” is housed <br>
		at the nearby Perimeter Institute, and receives the other half of the entangled photons."</li>

	<li>"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly 
	programmed.<br> In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical 
	speech recognition, <br>effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human 
	genome. Machine learning <br>is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a 
	day without knowing it. Many researchers <br>also think it is the best way to make progress 
	towards human-level AI."

<p>	"In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine
	learning techniques, and gain practice<br>implementing them and getting them to work for 
	yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not  <br>only the theoretical underpinnings 
	of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly <br> and powerfully apply
	these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's <br> best
	practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI."
