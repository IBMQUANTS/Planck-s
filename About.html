		<li>The Future Of Communication is here.</li><br> "One way we might see communication 
		change in the future is through augmented reality. In an<br>augmented-reality system, you 
		
		view the world through a technological overlay. This could take<br> the form of a hand-held 
		device like a smartphone -- there are several augmented-reality applications <br>already available
		for some phones. Another possible application is through a set of augmented-reality<br> glasses.
		In either case, you can view the world around you and see real-time digital information about <br>
		what you're viewing. 
		
	<p>The classic example of augmented reality is the restaurant review.You couldstand in front of a restaurant<br> and, through an augmented-reality system, read customer reviews or 
		view the daily specials without ever<br> walking inside. But the applications don't have to stop with
		locations.Augmented-reality systems might<br> extend to people as well. Imagine looking at a stranger 
		and seeing that person's name, Facebook profile, <br>Twitter handle and other information. Clearly, 
		augmented reality systems will raise concerns about privacy<br> and safety, but such systems are already 
		in development."

		<li>The Past:</li>
		<br>
		"In the late 1700′s and early 1800′s the first telegraph was invented. The 
		telegraph system was a form of <br>communication that transmitted electric signals over wires from
		different locations to translate messages.<br> The first telegraph was invented by Claude Chappe in
		1794, this telegraph was not electric, it was a <br>“semaphores,or tall poles with movable arms, and 
		other signaling apparatus, set within physical sight<br> of one another.” Many others tried to reinvent
		and improve the way telegraphs worked. However,<br> Samuel Morse was the only one who perfected it. 
		Morse took the significance of those facts found by <br>previous inventors and invented a more practical 
		and commercial system."

		<li>Our Future:</li>
		 <br>
		"The advancement in technology like the Internet, computers 
		and tablets has changed the dynamics<br> of the print industry tremendously. Newspaper,
		Magazine, and Book circulation is at its lowest, the <br>print industry is expected to 
		lose 25% of its jobs over the next few years. The print industry is<br> drastically declining 
		because the Internet has and continues to shape the way we communicate.<br> The future of print
		is not very bright, in my opinion I do not believe that print will be a part of the<br> future
		because there will be no need for anything printed. While the print industry is suffering
		it is<br> predicted that applications like eBook, iBook, and audiobook are expected to increase
		vastly. In a<br> few years newspapers, books, and advertisements will all be created and made 
		only for online."

	<br>
	<br>
	
	"Therefore, future technology should be more compatible with people’s needs; tablets
	should be<br> Nano sized, lite and slick, interactive, and portable. Users should be able to
	explore endless possibilities<br> from writing word documents to creating and designing websites.
	Future tablets should be able to bend,<br> fold, and roll while giving the user the experience of
	reading a book or a magazine.  Prospective tablets<br> should allow users to browse the web, take 
	pictures, upload, and watch videos. Upcoming tablets should<br> not take away people interacting 
	with each other but it should enhance people’s interaction globally.<br> Upcoming tables should
	translate different languages making it easy for users to communicate internationally."

	<li> "Analyzing the concept and processes of innovation is to make<br> a distinction between
	Revolutionary and Evolutionary Innovation." </li>
	<br>
	<li>"Companies and economies that rely on evolutionary innovation<br> need to keep that innovation
	coming at a rapid rate or they will get <br> left behind by someone else’s innovations.  Similarly, 
	no matter how <br> quickly they may innovate in many small ways, evolutionary <br> innovators are subject
	to game changers from the revolutionary <br> innovators." 
	
	<p>"In the long run, businesses and economies probably benefit from<br>  having a combination of both 
	forms of innovation, which means<br> having the social and economic infrastructure to support both."</li>
